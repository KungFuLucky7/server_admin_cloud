The taxonomy of the genus remains controversial, but most botanists currently favor a classification involving five or more species. In this sense, Pteridium aquilinum is distributed widely in mostly the northern hemisphere, in both the New and Old Worlds.\r\n\r\nBracken produces a pharmacopeia of toxic compounds, including: thiaminase (which breaks down the amino acid thiamine and results in vitamin B deficiency), ecdysomes (hormones that stimulate uncontrolled early molting in insects), tannins (which bind to proteins and other compounds), and hydrogen cyanide, and also produces carcinogenic compounds. The combination of chemicals renders the plants toxic to most animals, both invertebrates and vertebrates, although some insect specialists ingest bracken tissue to become poisonous to their predators. Humans have long eaten the fiddleheads (emerging young leaves) of bracken, but over-ingestion of fresh or dried fronds has been linked to stomach and esophageal cancers.\r\n\r\nBracken is an aggressive colonizer of disturbed and other successional habitats and has been considered an invader of pastureland. It has been shown to be allelopathic (to produce compounds that inhibit the growth of other plant species) and can for dense monocultures. It is difficult to eradicate or control and, because it is toxic, renders such pasturage unfit for grazing.

Most species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere, though their range extends into the northern subtropics. Many other plants have \"lily\" in their common name but are not related to true lilies.\r\n\r\nThe botanic name Lilium is the Latin form and is a Linnaean name. The Latin name is derived from the Greek \u03bb\u03b5\u03af\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, le\u00edrion, generally assumed to refer to true, white lilies as exemplified by the Madonna lily.[2] The word was borrowed from Coptic (dial.

Meillet maintains that both the Egyptian and the Greek word are possible loans from an extinct, substratum language of the Eastern Mediterranean.

All English translations of the Bible render the Hebrew sh\u016bshan, sh\u014dshan, sh\u014dshann\u0101 as \"lily\", but the \"lily among the thorns\" of Song of Solomon, for instance, may be the honeysuckle.", "timestamp": "2014-06-19T18:09:33.021Z", "revision_notes": "Lilies are tall perennials ranging in height from 2\u20136 ft (60\u2013180 cm). They form naked or tunicless scaly underground bulbs which are their overwintering organs. In some North American species the base of the bulb develops into rhizomes, on which numerous small bulbs are found. Some species develop stolons. Most bulbs are deeply buried, but a few species form bulbs near the soil surface. Many species form stem-roots. With these, the bulb grows naturally at some depth in the soil, and each year the new stem puts out adventitious roots above the bulb as it emerges from the soil. These roots are in addition to the basal roots that develop at the base of the bulb.\r\n\r\nThe flowers are large, often fragrant, and come in a range of colours including whites, yellows, oranges, pinks, reds and purples. Markings include spots and brush strokes. The plants are late spring- or summer-flowering. Flowers are borne in racemes or umbels at the tip of the stem, with six tepals spreading or reflexed, to give flowers varying from funnel shape to a \"Turk's cap\". The tepals are free from each other, and bear a nectary at the base of each flower. The ovary is 'superior', borne above the point of attachment of the anthers. The fruit is a three-celled capsule.[4]\r\n\r\nSeeds ripen in late summer. They exhibit varying and sometimes complex germination patterns, many adapted to cool temperate climates.\r\n\r\nNaturally most cool temperate species are deciduous and dormant in winter in their native environment. But a few species which distribute in hot summer and mild winter area (Lilium candidum, Lilium catesbaei,Lilium longiflorum) lose leaves and remain relatively short dormant in Summer or Autumn, sprout from Autumn to winter, forming dwarf stem bearing a basal rosette of leaves until accept enough chilling requirement, the stem begins to elongate while warming", "observation_type": "Area", "lifeform": "forb", "longitude": -7.9048775, "phenology": "full-grown", "onserpentine": false}}, {"pk": 5, "model": "observations.observation", "fields": {"habitat": "freshwater", "image": "uploads/Sparganium emersum.jpg", "observername": "Jan \u0160ev\u010d\u00edk", "common_name": "European Bur-reed", "validated": false, "species": "Sparganium emersum", "numplants": 10, "devicename": "Samsung Galaxy S5", "family": "Typhaceae", "edited_on": null, "location": "Czech Republic", "latitude": 49.8037633, "gps": null, "uploaded": false, "edited_by": null, "description": "Sparganium emersum is a species of flowering plant in the cat-tail family known by the common name European bur-reed.

The fragrant, orchid-like flowers are usually 10 to 15 centimetres (3.9 to 5.9 in) across, and bloom from early November to the end of March. Although now cultivated in many areas, it originated in Hong Kong in 1880 and apparently all of the cultivated trees derive from one cultivated at the Hong Kong Botanic Gardens and widely planted in Hong Kong starting in 1914.[2] It is referred to as bauhinia in non-scientific literature though this is the name of the genus. It is sometimes called the Hong Kong orchid (\u9999\u6e2f\u862d). Commonly called by the people of Hong Kong by its Chinese name of \u6d0b\u7d2b\u834a.\r\n\r\nThe Bauhinia double-lobed leaf is similar in shape to a heart or a butterfly. A typical leaf is 7 to 10 centimetres (2.8 to 3.9 in) long and 10 to 13 centimetres (3.9 to 5.1 in) wide, with a deep cleft dividing the apex. In Hong Kong the leaf is known as the \"clever leaf\" (\u8070\u660e\u8449), and is regarded as a symbol of wisdom. Some people use the leaves to make bookmarks in the hope that they will bring them good luck in their studies.\r\n\r\nIt is sterile, which means it does not generally produce seeds or fruits, and is a hybrid between Bauhinia variegata and Bauhinia purpurea.[2][3] The 2008 research was able to identify the female parent as Bauhinia purpurea, but it could not differentiate the male parent from Bauhinia variegata var. variegata or Bauhinia variegata var. candida. This is not unexpected, as Bauhinia variegata var. candida is a white-flowered form of Bauhinia variegata var. variegata, and not a separate species or sub-species. The 2005 research suggested Bauhinia blakeana is genetically closer to Bauhinia variegata, while the 2008 research indicated it is closer to Bauhinia purpurea instead.\r\n\r\nPropagation is by grafting, cuttings and air-layering. As it is only known in cultivation, it can also be named as a cultivar: Bauhinia 'Blakeana'.[2] Hong Kong orchid trees are usually sterile, yet here, too, there are exceptions. One tree has been found in Hong Kong that produces seeds, perhaps indicating that evolution or mutation has occurred, or that even though Bauhinia blakeana is perhaps sterile when self-pollinated (the scientific study in 2005 established the low fertility of Bauhinia blakeana's pollen when compared with its parental species Bauhinia purpurea or Bauhinia variegata), however, it may perhaps be able to produce seeds when pollinated instead by its parental species Bauhinia purpurea or Bauhinia variegata or other related Bauhinia species. More scientific research will need to be carried out, eg, artificial controlled cross-pollination experiments to confirm the ability of Bauhinia blakeana in backcross or outcross to produce (fertile) seeds.\r\n\r\nDr Lawrence Ramsden of the University of Hong Kong\u2019s Department of Botany is keen to find out if there are any more individuals that can produce seeds \u2013 if so, they could benefit propagation of the tree for horticulture.[4] Two previous instances of seeds found from Bauhinia blakeana specimens failed to germinate.", "timestamp": "2014-06-19T19:10:16.836Z", "revision_notes": "", "observation_type": "Traveling", "lifeform": "forb/herb, shrub, tree", "longitude": 114.1052699, "phenology": "full-grown", "onserpentine": false}}]
